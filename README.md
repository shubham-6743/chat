# GPT3-powered React chatbot

This is a simple React chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT3 API to generate responses to user input. Optionally it can correct the errors in the things you type.

Try it out under https://vuizur.github.io/react-gpt3-chatbot/.

It requires an OpenAI API key, which however is only saved in the brower and not sent to anyone (except OpenAI to get the dialogue completions).
